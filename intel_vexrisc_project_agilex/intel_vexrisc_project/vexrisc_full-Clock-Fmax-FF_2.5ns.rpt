Fast Forward Compilation enabled: Post-place & route results are analyzed to provide step-by-step recommendations for suggested RTL changes and show the estimated performance improvement from making these changes
- Fmax/Slack: Estimated performance from retiming existing registers in the design
- Relationship: Timing relationship between launch and latch clock edge
- Achieved with Hyper-Retiming: Estimated performance from analyzing optimizations to remove restrictions that prevent registers from retiming
- Achieved with Hyper-Pipelining: Estimated performance from analyzing optimizations to add new registers to the design to pipeline paths better
- Achieved with Hyper-Optimization: Estimated performance from analyzing optimizations to further improve the design
